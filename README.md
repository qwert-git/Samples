# Paging Sample
There is an example of how to create pagination for the API, using the separate service 'ApiPagingService' to modify the query before execution.
This approach is good because it is possible to continue editing queries after the paging condition have been set. 
It's easy to test and easy to change the implementation if the data source will be changed.
